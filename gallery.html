             <p align="left"> School Website Redesign(Professional Communication, Teamwork and Collaboration, Use of Resources)
             <br> This project was done during winter of 2016, in my Web Design 2 class, my Junior year. The goal of this project was to redesign our school website in a way that we believed would help make it more visually appealing and easier to navigate. This was a group project, specifically mine consisted of 3 other memeber, each with a different role in redesigning the website. My role was Programer 1, working together with the one in charge of making the sitemap and organizing the content so that I could set up the basic HTML code with all of the information needed. I have to keep it simple enough so that Programer 2 can implement the CSS while still including all of the necessary content. From there I worked with program 2 to make the website responsive. After the website was done we had to present it to administrators to the school as well as the senior Web Design class. We had to dress professionally and pitch the idea, because we were trying to make them pick our website as if they were buying it. In the end I learned a lot from this project. I still need to work on some of the basics coding wise, and I really need to familiarize myself with how to make websites responsive. Also, we need to be more confident in our product, clients don't want to hear negatives about a project from the pitchers themselves.</p>

             <br> This project was done during winter of 2016, done in my Graphic Design 3 class and presented in my Web Design 2 Class, my Junior year. The purpose of the project was to let us experience what it means to work with clients. Specifically this is the second client work we've done, so this time we were applying all that we had learned from our our first client project.We were told to design a logo for LVGEA's 60th anniversary, and we were to do the necessary research and put in rigorous work in order to make the best logos possible for our client. When it was time for the clients to come in and pick the logos they were interested in they chose mine along with a handful of other students logos to present. I went up and explained my thought process behind the logos, such as why I chose certain colors, shapes, and what it all represnted in the logo. The whole thing was an amazing experience, and though it I was able to gain experience in working and talking with clients effectively.</p>

             <br>This project was done during winter of 2016, in my Graphic Design 3 class, of my Junior year. This was the first time we had ever done one-on-one client work in our graphic design class. As such we had to be quick on our feet and learn the good from the bad when making our logos and what our client wanted to see from us. After about 2 weeks of working on our logos it was time for our client, Melissa Scott, to come in and hear the pitches for our logos. From this project I was able to gain experience in working and communicating with a client. It also showed me that, while i do have my strengths as a graphic designer, I also have things that I need to continue working on in order to really stand out amongst my peers.</p>

             <p align="left">Javascript Quiz(Content Knowledge, Teamwork and Collaboration)
             <br> This project was done durng fall of 2015, in Web Design 2, my Junior year. This project is all about Javascript. Before the project we had spent weeks watching Lynda videos, following along and taking notes on the varius commands needed in order to make everything work. Once the project started we got into groups consisting of 2 people. I was in charge of setting up the basic HTML and he was to make the wireframe and mockup. Then, once we got into the Javascript part of the project we would work together, helping each other out so that we can get the website up and running. Once we were done with the website it was time to present to the class, showing that the javascript was working correctly by having the questions randomly generate and show which questions you got right or wrong. By the end of it I had realized some very important things. First of all, javascript is not something that you can just do, you need to really understand everyhting that goes into it or else nothing will work, so I'll have to work on that. Next while our teamwork definitely wasn't horrible it definitely could have been better. We should have more effectively planned out everything with eachother before working in the javascript, doing so would have saved us a lot of time and stress in the long term.</p>

             <p align="left">Creativity Project(Use of resources, Work ethic)
             <br> This project was done during fall of 2015, in Graphic Design 3, for my Junior year. This project is all about letting our imagination get the better of us. We were to pick a theme that we wanted to explore, which could ahve ranged anywhere from hairstyles in the 60s to skateboarding. The theme you picked didnt matter, what mattered is that you could express the theme you picked as best as you could. My theme was imaginary/fictional worlds. Basically I had to convey the idea that the world that I was imagining in my head could be brought out in my drawing, and that the viewer could also see what I was seeing. I decided to draw a very dark world, militaristic, with a menacing glow coming from the moon. It's suppoused to convey the uneasiness and fear that would have been present in the setting I was trying to convey. After the Project was done I realized that I had repeated what I had dont in the fable animation project. Since I was so confident in my artistic skill I lost sight of the bigger picture of the project. I made a really cool drawing, but it wasn't really conveying my theme as best as it could. So, in the future I hope that I will remember this moment and not make the same mistake again.</p>

             <p align="left">Dante's Inferno Website(Teamwork and collaboration, Professional Communication, Content Knowledge)
             <br>This Project was done during fall of 2014, in Web Design 1, during Sophmore year. This was the first client project that we would do. After reading Dante's Inferno in our English class we were tasked with making a website that represented all nine circles of Hell described in the book. This was a group project, I worked with four other people on it. I was in charge of brainstorming and making the graphcis for the website. We decided early on that if this website was going to be used by the school then we dont wan't to use any copyrighted images, so we'll just make our own. For each of the circles of hell I would sketch out an idea, show it to the group for approval, and then line and color it in Illustrator. While the graphics did take much longer than usual we were able to get them into the website before the deadline. Then we presented the website to one of the english teachers here at SWCTA along with the other groups in the class. In the end we won primarily due to the original graphics and the amazing code done by one of our group memebers. From this I got my very first peek at effectively working with a client. It also forced me to puch my work ethic since, as a group, we were all relying on each other to get our share of the work done in order to make the deadline.</p>

             <p align="left">Hour of Code (Work ethic, Teamwork and collaboration, content knowledge)
             <br>This project was done during Fall of 2015, in Web Design 2, during my Junior year. This is the biggest project I have ever been in. The goal is to teach an entire school of elementary school kids the basic concepts of coding in an hour. The project involved the entire web design program area and a elementary school nearby. In the beginning we had to break into groups to decide who would be handling the marketing, website, scripts for all the grade levels, and who would manage this whole event. I was one of the people that was going to be making scripts. Me and my partner would be making the script for teaching the 4th grade students. From there it would be weeks of brainstorming and meettings with other groups to share the progress we had made. Eventually the day came where we went to the school and test all that we had worked on for months. While there were some time managements problems in the beginning everyone was able to recover and the whole thing went incredibly well. From this amazing experience I was able to effectively work with my partner to make up scripts, use everything I had used so far to make fun activities for the 4th graders, and pushed myself to work even harder than I ever had before.</p>

             <br> This project was done during summer of 2015, in Graphic Design 3, during my Junior year. This project was all about refamiliarizing ourselves with how Flash works along with introducing us to Flash's version of coding, action script. This was a group project, aside from me there were two others that were in the group. The goal is to make a simple interactive shooter game in flash, with a win and lose screen. Again, I was in charge of graphics for this project while the others were doing the actionscript. At this point I'm confident that making graphics in my strongest quality due to my artistic ability. And, with the other members of my group working on the coding that means that I can put one hundred percent of my focus into making those said graphics. Once I was done all that was left was to implement the graphics into the action script, which wasnt very difficult at all. Through this project I realized what my biggest strength is, along with learning the basics of action script.</p>

             <p align="left">Argumentative Speech(Professional Communication, Teamwork and collaboration, content knowledge, writing skills, use of resources)
             <br>This Project was done during the winter of 2015, English 11 honors, in my Junior year. This project is very heavy with the research aspect. The whole point of this is to find a debateable topic from online and then make a speech around it, choosing if you are for or against the topic. This was a group project, so me and my partner both had to agree on a topic and which side we would argue. Eventually we made our speech topic about "Allowing Conscription in the USA." Once we had the topic we then had do do more research, this time on our side of the argument. After weeks of reaseraching we did a six minute presentation in front of the class. Looking back on it, the whole thing could have been better. We could have done with a bit more research and rehearsel. Once we were up we froze up for a bit a stuttered a bit, and our research seemed a bit underwhelming. So, in the future if we have to do another project similiar to this I'll remember what I need to work on the most.</p>

             <br>This project was done during summer of 2014, in Web Design 1, during my Sophmore year. This was the very first coding based project that I did in Web Design. We were just starting to learng the basic of coding through watching lynda videos and following along. eventually we were tasked with trying to make a portfolio while using everything that we had used from all of the videos. As we learned more throughout the year the portfolio would change ever so slightly. it wasn't really about making it look incredible, its was primarily just used for implementing any new lines of code that we would learn. Even though it was a guinea pig I learned a lot from this "pre-'porfolio." It showed me what would and wouldn't work on a website as well as familiarzing me with a bucnh of new concepts that wouldn't have made much sense otherwise.</p>

             <br>This project was done during the summer of 2014, in Web Design 1, during my Sophmore year. Before we really got into the coding aspect of the Web Design class we first had to learn a bit about the background of coding. One of the ways we did that was by doing this PSA project. The purpose was to make a fun little PSA video for the class talking about the basics of web, why its important, and why people are learning it. I was put into a group of 4 and from there we each had a couple of lines that we would read while we film. We went around the campus for a bit to record the video. It was a simple, fun, little project. But, it was very effective as a stepping stone into learning the first lines of code that would follow in a couple of days.</p>

             <p align="left">Hip Hop IT PBL
             <br> This Project was done during fall of 2014 during my Sophmore year. This was my first experience with a PBL at this school. It was a very big event, and had a great sense of energy about it. It began with a couple of hip hop dance kids teaching groups of us how to dance. Then the next day it was our turn to teach them something. We taught them throgh a bunch of coding based games and avtivities that they would rotate to throughout the day. By the end of it all we had learned the basics of hip hop dancing, and they had learning the basics of coding and game development. Although once it was all done I couldn;t help but feel like the activites that we had planned out were a bit too complicated for some of them. One of the things we didnt take into account was that the group consisted of students whose age would range from around 7-15. So, in the future if we were to do this again then maybe we could do activities that would be easily understood and fun for all ages.</p>

             <br> This project was done during summer of 2015, in Graphic Design 1, during my Sophmore year. This was the end of the year project for my graphic design 1 class. The point of this project was to collect all of the works that we had done throughout the years and compile them into a digital portfolio. While It wasn't meant as a portfolio to show clients or employers this was still good exeprience for making an actualy portfolio. If had to take anything from this it would be not to put everything you've done into your portfolio. When sending work to a potential employer all you really want to show them is your very best work.</p>

             <br> This project was done during summer of 2015, in Graphic Design 2, during my Sophmore year. This is one of the first competitions that my class participated in. We were tasked with making a poster for the upcoming Brian Head event. The project was very fun for me and other very creative students since the only real guidlines were to make sure that the year and the words Brian head were on the poster. In other words we had full creative reign over how we wanted the psoter to look. I went all out on the artistic aspect and just went and drew everything like I had with many other projects before. But, like many other projects where I had gone all out with my artistic tendencies I forgot the bigger picutre. While I think of myslef as a pretty good artist for my age the fact of the matter is that it didn't look poster worthy. Drawing everything is nice for the class, but when designing for a competition I really should have gone with nice clean graphics instead. That's something that I have to keep in mine as I continue to work on projects throughout my school year.</p>

             <br>This project was done during winter of 2014, in Graphic Design 2, during my Sophmore year. This holiday themed project. We were to make a card that reflected the Christmas spirit to us. So, I decided to draw out a scene of people drinking hot chocolate at a cafe. i really wanted to express the cozyness that I felt always acompanied the holiday season. Also, for once, me giving into my artistic tendencies wasn't a bad thing. This time I didn't lose sight of the bigger picture, and the final image actually does give off a bit of a cozy tone within it. From this I learned that as long as I keep the bigger picutre in my head then I do a lot better in my final product.</p>

             <br>This Project was done during fall of 2015, in English 11 honors, during my Junior year. This project was asking us to explain who we believed is most at fault for the current events happening in Salem. Once we picked a character we would have to back up our claim with various quotes from the book. We would give a statement and then back it up with whatever quotes we could find that best helps our argument. by doing this I was able to improve my writing skills as well as my use of resources. On top of that this essay was done at a very fast pace, forcing me to improve my work ethic as the days went on.</p>

             <br> This project was done during fall of 2015, in English 11 honors, during my Junior year. This project was also about "The Crucible," but this time we were comaping it with the HUAC trials that occured in America during the cold war era. Both the HUAC trials and the salem witch trials shared similiarities. It was up to me and my 3 partners to figure out exactly how they connect to each other. We were to use textual evidence from both the book and form HUAC trial reports and news articles. By then end of it my writing skills had improved even mor, my work ethic had become for efficicent, and I knew how to make the most out of the resources I was given. To top it all off the group I had worked very well with each other and we learned so very effective ways to help eachother out when we were having trouble with the work. </p>

                 <br>This project was done around winter of 2014, my sophmore year, in Graphic Design 2. This project was a way for us to familiarize ourselves with Flash after learning the basics for week. For this project we had to choose one of Aesop's fables to adapt in a short Flash animation. As long as we kept along the guidelines of the original fable we were able to draw whatever we wanted to. Through this project I was able to see the limits of what I was capable of doing with my skillset at the time. Specifically it made me realize that I would need much more than my skills as an artist in order to do every assignment in the class as best as I can, I would also need to know how to effectively use Flash and basic editing software in order to make the product the best it can be.</p>
